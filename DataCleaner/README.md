# Overview

On my final project I developed an R script to demonstrate my understanding of the R language and its capabilities for data cleaning and preprocessing. The goal was to create a simple example that reads CSV data and then cleans it by handling missing values and performs basic data manipulation tasks. This software serves as a practical exercise in applying my programming skills to real world data challenges.

# Development Environment

- **Editor/IDE:** I used Visual Studio Code with the R extension.
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Libraries:** The script thats usually used by R functions. As well as additional use of functions for CSV file manipulation.
